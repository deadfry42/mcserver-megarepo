# mcserver plugin megarepo
all of the plugins I custom made especially for my minecraft server!  

Plugins and what they do:
- DFSmpPlugin
  - Used in the SMP server and the Skyblock server.
  - Adds custom content to make survival more fun.
  - Implements a custom combat logger.
  - Requires a custom resourcepack.
- DFTrueOneBlock
  - Originally intended to be a "One block Skyblock" server plugin, has expanded far too out of scope.
  - Tweaks vanilla features to be more suited for skyblock (coming soon)
  - Implements a custom GUI
  - Can run on one server, all of the skyblock worlds are different files (probably, hasn't been implemented yet)
- DFProxyPlugin
  - A simple velocity plugin to send a chat message when the player joins.
- DFLobbyPlugin
  - Teleports players to the world spawn when joined
  - Supresses join / leave messages
  - Implements custom commands to join different servers in the same BungeeCord/Velocity (with bc compatibility enabled) server.
- DFInhibition
  - Prevents players from modifying the world in any way before the /startsmp command is run
  - Prevents players from entering the nether, the end and pvping until their respective commands have been run.
  - Commands can only be ran on the server console.
